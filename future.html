                    <h2>What does Motocross look like in the Future?</h2> <br><br>
                    <p>Every year in motocross, the bikes get lighter, faster, more aesthetic, and safer. There have already been electric bikes starting to come into the market, especially smaller ones for kids aged 3-10 years old. There are also many electric bikes for adults, and while they do not necessarily have as good components as modern 4-strokes, they are still really solid bikes and can easily be upgraded to suit rider skill levels. <br><br>
                    The problem comes when you mix electric bikes with normal petrol-driven bikes because you just cannot physically hear an electric bike coming when you are riding on a 2 or 4-stroke dirt bike. There have been some races in the past where they have let e-bikes like the KTM SX-E race with the 50cc dirt bikes, and the riders on the e-bikes were complaining about people constantly running into them and cutting them off. When they asked the other riders in the race about this they said they didn’t even realise that they were doing it because they simply couldn’t hear them. As you can imagine, this could become incredibly dangerous, because often the lines a rider takes would be different if there was someone next to them, to avoid running them off the track. Of course in places like America, where the sport of motocross is huge, and they have the funds and riders to do so, they have a completely separate class for electric bikes, so that they are all looking out for each other. This is still incredibly dangerous, but at least they are all in the same situation, so they will be looking out for each other. 
                    <br><br>
                    Many things about motocross will change in the future, and it is hard to say whether the safety will improve as well, or if it will become even more dangerous. You will never be 100% safe on a dirt bike, but as long as you train and prepare, everything else is out of your control. </p>
