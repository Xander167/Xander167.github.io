                <h1>Motocross Safety and Development</h1>
                    <div class="p1">
                        <p>The safety of <a class="LINK" href="https://riskracing.com/blogs/news/what-is-motocross" target="_blank">Motocross</a> is one of the biggest problems that riders, track owners, and officials face all over the world. This term I decided to dig a bit deeper and look at how far the sport has already come, and what the future of motocross looks like.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="p2">
                        <h2><strong>What can you do to improve your safety while riding?</strong></h2>
                        
                        <p>Being physically fit before getting on the motorcycle, will drastically decrease the chance of injury, but there is always the slightest chance of having a crash, and there is nothing you can do about it. It is this unpredictability that causes so many people to continuously come back to the sport because sometimes you never really know what is going to happen, and it's the adrenaline rush in the split-second decisions that you are required to make, that makes it so exciting and addicting. </p>

                        <p id="sub-topics">No matter what you do, you can never be 100% safe when riding a dirt bike. But if you take the right precautions, you can decrease your chances of injury, and although these don’t guarantee you won't get hurt, they do guarantee that you will be better off in the rare event that you do have a crash.</p>

                        <p>There are a few main things that will help decrease the risk of injury:</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="p3">
                        <h3>1. Training off the bike</h3>

                        <p>Training is a big part of motocross, both on and off-the-bike training can drastically improve your riding. Training on the bike is fairly straightforward with pretty much any sort of riding making you a stronger, safer, and faster rider. Sometimes it is good to not just ride as fast as you can, but to put some thought into it and do some drills or add a twist to your riding. Some of the most common drills to try are racing down a hill and the last person there wins (which can be done anywhere), or track drills like stand up only, always keeping your feet on the pegs, or just focussing on technique rather than speed.
                        <br><br>
                        Training off the bike is also a big part of motocross, and riders can improve rapidly if they set up some sort of program or routine and stick to it. Most riders aim to hit the gym as often as possible, and generally at least once a day. 
                        <br>
                        Some of the most important things to make sure of when hitting the gym to train for motocross are:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Warming up for about 10 minutes (stretching and/or light cardio)</li>
                            <li>Doing either 5-15 minutes of high-intensity exercises, strength training, or cardio</li>
                            <li>80-90% Maximum effort – Not being lazy and focussing on pushing yourself</li>
                            <li>Using light weights for a short duration or doing body-weight exercises</li>
                            <li>Training to the point of failure when training strength</li>
                            <li>Focussing on breathing (especially exhaling) <br>
                            When riding it is often hard to remember, amongst everything else, to breathe. Often you will find yourself tiring really easily, simply because you are not breathing properly, or may be barely breathing at all. This is why you should prioritise correct breathing during workouts as it is a good habit to develop and will help with your riding. As a general rule, try to exhale on the hard movement and inhale on the easy movement. For example, if you are doing pullups, exhale on the way up because that is the hard movement.</li>
                            <li>Incorporating balance and grip strength as much as possible<br>
                            These are two key things that are essential for a motocross rider to have. You should also do lots of cardio to get your heart rate up and get used to your heart rate being high and recovering quickly. Everyone's training routine needs to be different, and this is where it might be a good idea to find a coach. A coach will help you find your weaknesses, and find out what you need to be training more of.</li>
                            <li>Doing more HIIT style workouts (High Intensity Interval Training)
                            <br>
                            HIIT workouts are intervals of high-intensity exercises followed by periods of rest. They aim to get the heart rate very high and into the anaerobic state, and develop quicker recovery times.
                            <br><br>
                            Motocross riders can enter an anaerobic state for most of the race. HIIT workouts are a good way to teach yourself and your body to get out of this bad habit, and to breathe more efficiently which will produce energy more efficiently. Motocross riders also experience something called arm pump, where your arms, hands, and fingers can feel like they are swollen or extremely tight, or in some cases even go numb. When riders experience this, it is many times harder to control the bike, and a big factor that causes arm pump is being in that anaerobic state.  
                            Arm pump can also be a leading factor towards crashes on a dirt bike, so HIIT workouts are making you a far more consistent and safe rider as well.

                        <h3>2. Wearing Protective Gear or Clothing</h3>
                        <p>There is so much on offer if you are looking for protective gear for motocross. If you are willing to spend the money, you can get protection for just about anything you want. Obviously, if you are a complete beginner, it may not be as necessary to buy that $1000 helmet or get the new state-of-the-art knee braces. But that being said, when you are new to motocross, you want to feel confident that if you do crash, you won't get hurt. Once you start going to motocross tracks for practice days, you will need to get some serious gear, because you now have the added danger of the other riders. You will also likely have jumps on whatever track you go to, which are a leading factor towards major crashes.
                        <br><br>
                        Once you start riding at motocross tracks, here are some of the essentials you will need: <br><br>
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><div class="title">Helmet</div><br>
                            Make sure to take your time when choosing a helmet, and try not to worry too much about how it looks, because it is more important to get one that fits well rather than a certain brand you want. If you are racing it is probably necessary to spend a bit more money on a helmet with some sort of MIPS which is a rotating inner shell in the helmet to help prevent concussions and other head injuries.</li><br>
                            <li><div class="title">Boots</div><br>
                            You will need motocross boots, even if you are just riding a track on a practice day. Proper motocross boots go almost up to your knees and without them you cannot shift, brake, stand, or support yourself properly. Boots play a big role in preventing ankle injuries, which are very uncommon in motocross these days, simply because of how high the standards of boots are.</li><br>
                            <li><div class="title">Chest/Back Protector</div><br>
                            Chest and back protectors almost always come together, and you can sometimes get them in a jacket with elbow and shoulder pads as well. Many riders choose to wear a vest-style chest and back protector, as the elbow and shoulder pads can get inconvenient, and it is really up to rider preference. You can also get chest and back protectors with built-in neck braces, which are also a good form of protection, but many riders choose not to wear them because they restrict the amount you can turn your head which means you cannot look behind or to the side of you.</li><br>
                            <li><div class="title">Jersey/Pants</div><br>
                            Pants are definitely required to stop burns on your skin, burns on the fabric, and to tuck into your boots and jersey. You might be able to get away with wearing a jumper or long sleeve shirt instead of a jersey, and there is no real reason not to, other than it looks a bit odd. In super muddy conditions, you will find most riders wearing jackets or jumpers on top of their jersey, either so it doesn't get wet or so they don't get cold.</li><br>
                            <li><div class="title">Goggles and Gloves</div><br>
                            Both of these are also 100% essential. Without goggles, you would get mud in your eyes, even if you were just riding by yourself, let alone riding with 10-20 other riders. <div id="Technique">And gloves help protect your hands from rocks and mud and make it easier to use the controls like the throttle, clutch, and front brake, which are all hand-operated.</div> </li><br>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="p5">
                        <h3>3. Practicing Good Technique</h3>
                        <p>Your technique plays a big role in not only your riding style but also your safety. A rider with poor technique would be more prone to crashes than a rider that has perfect technique. This is often why faster riders crash less, because the faster you get, you are forced to improve your technique or it will not end well. There are so many things that you need to make sure you are doing when you ride, that are not very apparent when you first get on a bike. This is why it is a good idea to find a coach even if you are a newer rider because once you start to develop bad habits, they are very hard to break. The major technical points to make sure of when ridings are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><h4>Elbows up</h4> <br><br>
                                The main thing that putting your elbows up helps with is your stability on the bike. When going through turns, if you have your elbows down, or even just your inside elbow down, you are likely to fall inside of your bike and tip over. The same thing applies everywhere else, whether that be in the air, accelerating down straights
                            </li> <br>
                            <li><h4>Squeeze the bike with your knees</h4> <br><br>
                                Squeezing the bike helps with multiple things. First of all, it helps to connect you to the bike and feel in control because the bike is less likely to go sideways when hitting bumps. It also helps you to ride for longer and reduces arm pump. Arm pump is something that most riders experience and is basically when your hands feel extremely tight, or go numb. It happens because riders try to death-grip the handlebars, when in fact, 80-90% of your grip strength should be coming from your waist down. You should be gripping hard with your knees, especially under acceleration, and have your ankles locked tight into the bike so you can squeeze with your ankle and boot as well.
                            </li> <br>
                            <li><h4>Knees back when standing</h4> <br><br>
                                There are rare exceptions to this, but for the most part, when you are standing up and especially braking, your knees should not go further forward than the footpegs. You can have a slight bend in your knees, but keep in mind that the bike has suspension for a reason and generally, you should try to remain stiff at the knees and not collapse into the bike on impact.
                            </li> <br>
                            <li><h4>Look where you want to go</h4> <br><br>
                                Your eyes and vision play a big role in where you end up. If you are looking down at the ground right in front of you, not only are you in danger if there is something unexpected ahead, but subconsciously, that is where the bike will go. When going through corners, make sure to look ahead and through the corner so you ride smoothly through the whole turn.
                            </li> <br>
                            <li><h4>Lean forward under acceleration and backward when braking</h4> <br><br>
                                This is mainly for beginner riders because once you start heading to motocross tracks, if you haven't already figured this out, you will very quickly. But one tip to help remember this is to think of the bike like a see-saw. When one thing happens, you have to counter-balance by doing the opposite. So when you accelerate, you are being dragged off the back of the bike, so to counterbalance this, you need to lean forward. And the exact opposite applies under braking. When you brake, you are getting pushed forwards, so you want to counterbalance this by leaning back. 
                                <div id="Maintenance">This is another reason why it is good to squeeze with your knees because it will significantly reduce the effects of being pulled off the bike when paired with the counter-balancing.</div>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="p6">
                        <h3>4. Routine Maintenance</h3>

                        <p>Routine maintenance of a dirt bike will increase the consistency of the machine, to not only prevent breakdowns, but this also increases the safety of the rider and makes sure that the bike doesn’t fail while riding, leading to a crash. 
                        <br><br>
                        2-stroke and 4-stroke bikes have many differences, but when it comes to maintenance, many things are the same. Some of the regular maintenance you should be doing to increase the safety of your bike, no matter what engine type it is, would be things such as: </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Washing and drying your bike after every ride</li>
                            <li>Changing the oil after every few rides</li>
                            <li>Changing and cleaning the air filter after every ride</li>
                            <li>Changing the spark plug every few rides</li>
                            <li>Checking for wear on the chain and sprockets</li>
                            <li>Tightening spokes</li>
                            <li>Checking fork air pressure</li>
                            <li>Checking tire air pressure</li>
                            <li>Checking coolant levels</li>
                            <li>Checking over exhaust for damage and repacking muffler if it starts sounding different</li>
