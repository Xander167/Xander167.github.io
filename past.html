                    <h2>How Far has Motocross Come Already?</h2>
                    <p class="p8">In the very beginning, motocross was raced with heavy bikes which only had basic modifications to make them suit dirt and off-road surfaces. Since then, motocross has come a long way in terms of safety, with bikes getting lighter and more reliable each year. And with the bikes constantly getting faster, newer bikes now have fuel injection and many other technologies to make the bikes safe and reliable on top of the extra speed and forces that they are capable of. So the bikes have come a long way in terms of speed and safety, with them now being specially designed for motocross. And they are now able to be tuned for individual preferences and riding styles like adjusting the suspension for rider weight, speed, or skill level, compared to the original motocross races in the 1920s which used street-style bikes and had only basic modifications like dirt tires. 
                    <br><br>
                    At most motocross races and major events, they now have an ambulance crew on standby in case anything bad happens and someone needs further medical attention or surgery. There are also usually medically trained officials who know what to do in the case of a crash, which includes flag officials that spread out all over the track. </p>
                    <p id="History">And the protective gear has also improved heaps, with helmets specially designed to reduce concussions and vest-style chest and back protectors that are light, comfortable, and easy to wear while still giving you a ton of protection.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Evolution of Protective Gear</h3>
                    <p class="p9">In the 1967-68 International Motocross Series, James (Jimmy) N Roberts became one of the first people to introduce safety gear into motocross. He used protective equipment from other sports, like bolting a face guard from a grid-iron helmet to his motorbike helmet. He also wore grid-iron shoulder pads and a baseballer's shin pads which were somewhat strapped to his clothing. These homemade protective items were considered to be the start of many branding and company ideas, and the beginning of protective equipment in the sport. 
                    <br><br>
                    Before James (J.N.) started to promote padding and protective clothing in motocross, Aussie riders only wore an open-face helmet with goggles. He inspired many brands to produce protective gear, as well as other riders to wear it.

                    <h4>Equipment</h4>

                    <p>
                    Back a few years ago, companies decided to try and do some further research into what happens to the brain when your head undergoes a large impact, and they discovered a new class of injury. They found that your brain can rotate inside your skull and today were are seeing more and more helmet brands introduce their version of a helmet with a slightly rotating inner shell to try and prevent this. This invention is also commonly used in mountain biking helmets. 
                    <br><br>
                    Neck protection has also been introduced into motocross with some foam cushions that wrap around your neck, and also the more commonly used firm neck support that lets your helmet wrest upon, and sometimes even clips into your chest or back protector to stop it from moving. 
                    <br><br>
                    In the past, many riders were reluctant to wear a chest or back protector, simply because of how stiff and annoying they were. Especially in countries like America, where the majority of their races are in summer, most riders were just getting too hot in them and it was negatively affecting their performance. But especially Alpinestars, a popular motocross brand, have majorly improved their body armour, and their vest style chest and back protector is very common among riders these days because it does its job, while also being very light and comfortable. 
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    "Motorcycling, in whatever form you enjoy it, has risks associated with it. You can mitigate the risk by wearing good levels of protection and good product, but you can't remove the risk entirely. It's an unfortunate fact of life." - Jeremy Appleton, Alpinestars <br>
                    This quote pretty much sums up the sport, because no matter what you do there will always be a risk involved in motocross, but that doesn't mean that you should just do nothing.
